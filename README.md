# Vermont Fire Resource Deserts Map

Abstract:

We will build an interactive website that informs users of fire service resource deserts in Vermont. Our website will be centered around a single map containing two differ- ent layers of interest. The first layer will consist of a net- work analysis of average fire department response times to surrounding properties and structures. Building off the first layer, the second layer will illustrate accessibility to water sources. Combined, these layers will display local structures that fire departments can easily protect, while highlighting properties situated in fire resource deserts, rendering them more challenging for efficient and effective protection by first responders. Our hope is that this tool will allow local gov- ernmental organizations and agencies to be better prepared in the event of an emergency.
