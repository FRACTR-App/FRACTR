# Vermont Fire Resource Area Coverage and Response Times

Abstract:

This project provides a visual analysis of fire department resources and response time coverage across the state of Vermont in order to support regional emergency planning. To achieve this, we created a web-based application that displays interactive, multi-layered maps. The first map consists of a network analysis of average fire department response times across the state of Vermont. The second map is the same as the first, however, the response times from every fire station are bounded by the fire department's emergency service zone. The third map highlights areas that are in close proximity to fire hydrants, which can be used to extinguish fires. These maps are used to assess speed and efficiency of response to 911 calls, and emergency planning commissions across the state can utilize these maps and their creation methods to assess optimal locations for the construction of new fire stations and hydrants.
